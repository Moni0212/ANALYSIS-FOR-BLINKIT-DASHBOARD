# ANALYSIS-FOR-BLINKIT-DASHBOARD
🎉 Excited to Share My First Excel Dashboard Project! 📊

I recently created an interactive dashboard using Microsoft Excel as part of my data analytics learning journey. The project is based on Blinkit and focuses on analyzing things like sales, order trends, and product categories.

💡 Here’s What I Learned:

How to build dashboards using PivotTables, Slicers, and Charts

How to track key numbers like Average Order Value and Delivery Time

How to turn raw data into clear and useful insights

🖥️ Project Highlight:
The dashboard is interactive and easy to use — perfect for quickly checking key performance data and helping with business decisions.
